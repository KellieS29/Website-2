    <h2>#3 Caldo Verde</h2>
    <p><span class="resort">A popular soup in Portugal,</span> the Caldo Verde translates to “green broth”. It includes some of the most traditional Portuguese ingredients, including shredded Portuguese cabbage, potatoes, onion, garlic, and pieces of meat such as chourico or linguica. This dish is usually eaten as a starter or a late-night lighter dinner. But where did the Caldo Verde originate from? This traditional dish was born in Minho in northern Portugal. This is the best area to try out the dish, although it is available all over the country, even at McDonald’s!

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>10 ounces chouriço, linguiça, or Spanish chorizo, sliced into 1/4-inch (6-mm) coins</li>
      <li>1 large Spanish onion, diced</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, sliced; don’t be afraid to go for a third or fourth. We Portuguese love their garlic</li>
      <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped (I prefer Yukon Gold, as they as similar to Portugal's yellow potatoes)</li>
      <li>8 cups cold water, or half homemade chicken stock or canned chicken broth, and half water</li>
      <li>1 pound collard greens or kale, stems removed, leaves cut into very, very thin slices</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black or white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <li>In a large pot over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the chouriço and cook until lightly browned on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Using a slotted spoon remove the sausage to a plate. Try to let the sausage drain well into the pot; its fat will flavor the soup.</li>
      <li>Dump the onions into the pot. Sprinkle with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Stir in the potatoes, add the water or combination of water and chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the soup gently simmers. Cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the soup cool slightly.</li>
      <li>When the caldo verde has cooled a little, purée it using an immersion blender. (Tradition states that one slice and only one slice of chouriço is added to each bowl although some chefs like to add half the sausage to the soup before puréeing. It’s your choice.)</li>
      <li>Add the kale to the soup, bring everything back to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Season with more salt, if needed, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Ladle the caldo verde into bowls and garnish with the remaining slices of chouriço. (The soup can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated overnight. Simply warm over low heat before serving.)</li>
